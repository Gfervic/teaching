Let's plan a skype where you will run a morning lecture in front of Le Wagon's team and get our feedback.

## Setup

Before you start, please setup your computer with Sublime and Floobits as described in (our teaching guidelines)[https://github.com/lewagon/teaching]. You will use Floobits to run the course.

## Preparation

To help you prepare this course.

1. We will invite you to join Le Wagon's team on Github and you will receive a mail to accept invitation.

1. Once you’ve accepted the invitation, you will have access to our lecture platform and you can prepare this [Rails lecture](http://karr.lewagon.org/lectures/rails/02-rails-crud/#/). It’s a basic course about Rails CRUD where you will have to re-code Rails scaffold from scratch and explain all about it. Consider that students are in their 6th week of the fullstack program and that they already know ruby, ActiveRecord & SQL, as well as front-end and some ERB.

1. The preparation should take you about 1h. **Try to respect this timing**.

1. To prepare your course, you can have a look at [this video](https://vimeo.com/136631624) to help you. It’s in French (for the moment, but soon in English) but it's mainly live-code and it should give you a general idea on how we run a course in Paris.

## Mindset

- The idea is to use the slides as a frame to organize your ideas but not stick to it too much. You should make a very hands-on course with lots of live-code and outloud explanations on your code.
- We are not looking for traditional teachers able to discuss about code in a theoretical way. Instead, we love good developers who code with good practices and are able to explain what they do and why they do it. You should code in a course as you code in real-life.

We look forward to skype with you! Good luck!
