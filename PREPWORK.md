Here is a small preparation work to be teaching at Le Wagon.

## Setup

Before you start, please have a look at [our teaching guidelines](https://github.com/lewagon/teaching).

## Screencasts

We would like you to prepare and screencast two courses of the bootcamp:

- [Ruby, hash & symbols](https://vimeo.com/157108052)
- [Rails, introduction](https://vimeo.com/154831458)
- Vimeo password is `teachers-prepwork`
- Find the corresponding slides in the `prepwork` folder.

Some recommendations to help you prepare:

- Start by looking to the video (you can play it in accelerate mode) to understand the course's flow, the examples taken and the live-codes that are done. You can take notes on a sheet of paper.
- Go through the slides to see how you plan to alternate between slides and live-codes.
- Then just launch Quicktime, it's your turn.
- Preparation should take you about one hour.


Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions (at boris@lewagon.org). See you soon on the screen record!
