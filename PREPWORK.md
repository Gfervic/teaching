Here is a small preparation work to be teaching at Le Wagon.

## Setup

Before you start, please have a look at [our teaching guidelines](https://github.com/lewagon/teaching/blob/master/TEACHER.md).

## Screencasts

We would like you to prepare and screencast 1/2 courses of the bootcamp:

- [Ruby, hash & symbols](https://vimeo.com/157108052) for *backend teachers*
- [Rails, introduction](https://vimeo.com/154831458) for *backend teachers*
- [CSS components](https://vimeo.com/153903309) for *frontend teachers*
- Vimeo password is `teachers-prepwork`
- Slides are [here](https://github.com/lewagon/teaching/tree/master/prepwork)

Some recommendations to help you prepare:

- Start by watching the video (you can put "accelerate mode") to understand the flow of the course, the examples and the live-codes used. You can take notes on a sheet of paper.
- Then go through the slides to see how you plan to alternate between slides and live-codes.
- Preparation should take you about one hour.
- Finally, just launch Quicktime, it's your turn!

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions (boris@lewagon.org). 

See you on the screencast!
