# Teaching @ Le Wagon

Here is a list of recipes you can apply during a workshop or a lecture.

## Setup

The closer your own setup is to the [standard student's one](https://github.com/lewagon/setup),
the better. That way you can share with them keyboard shortcuts. We use [Sublime Text 2](https://github.com/lewagon/setup).

When you are video-projecting your screen, please follow these guidelines:

- The only app running on your computer should be Finder, Sublime Text, Terminal and Your Browser
- Have your text editor and terminal with a **light background**. You can install the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme, with the [Sublime Text package](https://github.com/braver/Solarized) and the [OSX terminal theme](https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized)
- Zoom a lot your font size (`⌘=`) in Sublime Text and your terminal.
- If you don't have a lot of files, hide the folder drawer on the left with `⌘K, ⌘B`.
- Switch from one file to the other with the `⌘P` (Command palete)
- You should use two windows layouts:
  - Sublime Text in full screen
  - Vertical split (50/50) with Sublime Text on the right, Terminal on the left
